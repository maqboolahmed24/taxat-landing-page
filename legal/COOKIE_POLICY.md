2. What are cookies and similar technologies?
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer, phone, tablet) when you visit a website. We may also use similar technologies that store information on, or access information from, your device. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as "cookies" in this policy.

Cookies can be:
- Session cookies: deleted when you close your browser; or
- Persistent cookies: remain for a set period (their "expiry").

Cookies can be:
- First-party: set by us (taxat.co.uk); or
- Third-party: set by other organisations whose tools/features we use.

3. Why we use cookies
We use cookies to:
A) Make the Site work properly and securely (strictly necessary).
B) Remember your preferences (e.g. cookie choices, language, display settings) where applicable.
C) Measure and improve the Site (analytics/performance), if you allow us.
D) Help us market Taxat and measure marketing performance (marketing), if you allow us.

4. Cookie choices and consent
When you first visit the Site, we show a cookie banner. You can:
- Accept all cookies;
- Reject non-essential cookies; or
- Choose cookie types via "Cookie settings".

We will not place non-essential cookies (e.g. analytics or marketing) unless you choose to enable them.
You can change your choices at any time by clicking "Cookie settings" (e.g. in the website footer).
Where technically possible, we apply your choices across our subdomains.

5. Types of cookies we use

5.1 Strictly necessary cookies (always on)
These cookies are required for the Site to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are typically used for:
- Security and fraud prevention;
- Load balancing and basic site operation;
- Remembering your cookie preferences so we don't keep asking you on every page.

If you disable these cookies in your browser, parts of the Site may not work properly.

5.2 Analytics cookies (optional)
If you enable analytics cookies, we use them to understand how visitors use our Site (e.g. which pages are visited, time on page, and errors), so we can improve it.
Analytics cookies may be provided by us and/or third-party analytics providers.

5.3 Functional cookies (optional)
If you enable functional cookies, they help us remember choices you make to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation (e.g. remembering preferences).

5.4 Marketing cookies (optional)
If you enable marketing cookies, these cookies may be used to:
- Measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns; and/or
- Help deliver relevant ads or content (where we use such tools).

We do not set marketing cookies unless you choose to enable them.

- Cookie name
- Provider (first-party or third-party)
- Category (necessary / analytics / functional / marketing)

Because the tools we use can change over time (e.g. we may add or remove analytics or marketing providers), we update this list whenever our cookies change.

You can also manage cookies using your browser settings (e.g. block or delete cookies). Each browser is different; you can usually find these controls under "Settings" or "Privacy".

Please note: Blocking all cookies may affect Site functionality.

8. Third-party features and embeds
If we embed third-party content (e.g. video players, calendars, social media links, or other widgets), those third parties may set cookies or use similar technologies. We aim to list these in "Cookie settings" where they apply.

9. Changes to this Cookie Policy
We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time (for example, if we change the cookies we use or if legal requirements change). We will update the "Last updated" date at the top.
