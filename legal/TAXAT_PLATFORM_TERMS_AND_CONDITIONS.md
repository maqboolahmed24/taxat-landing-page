3. Formation of the contract
3.1 Agreement
A contract between you and Taxat is formed when:
(a) you sign an Order Form referencing these Terms; or
(b) you accept these Terms online (for example, by clicking "I agree") and create an account; or
(c) you access or use the Services after being presented with these Terms.

3.2 Order of precedence
If there is a conflict between documents, the following order applies (highest first):
(1) Order Form (if any);
(2) any signed addendum;
(3) these Product Terms & Conditions;
(4) schedules and policies referenced by these Terms (including the Acceptable Use Policy and Data Processing Addendum).

4. Eligibility and business use
4.1 Business customers only
The Services are intended for business use. You confirm that you are acting in the course of business and not as a consumer.

4.2 Authority
You confirm that:
- the person accepting these Terms has authority to bind the Customer; and
- you will ensure all Authorised Users comply with these Terms.

5. The Services (what we provide)
5.1 What Taxat is
Taxat provides an "assurance/defence-first" workflow layer intended to help accountants improve evidence readiness and perform cross-source reconciliation prior to filing.

Depending on your plan and configuration, the Services may include:
- reconciling data across multiple sources that you connect (e.g., ledger exports/APIs, bank feeds, receipts/invoices, and where authorised, HMRC APIs);
- generating evidence linkages and traceability views (e.g., "Defence Graph" style outputs);
- providing discrepancy/risk visibility indicators (e.g., a "Compliance Risk Twin" view and a "Defence Score" indicator);
- producing action lists and/or task queues (e.g., "Autopilot" style reminders); and
- producing exports/reports (e.g., audit/defence packs), where enabled.

5.2 No HMRC affiliation / no internal HMRC access
Taxat is independent and not affiliated with HMRC. We do not access HMRC internal systems or replicate HMRC investigation decisioning. Where you choose to connect HMRC endpoints, those are official HMRC interfaces that operate only where the taxpayer/agent has authorised access.

5.3 AI-assisted features
Some features may use automation and/or AI to suggest linkages, categorisations, anomalies, or explanations. AI-assisted outputs are indicators and may be incorrect. You remain responsible for reviewing and validating outputs before relying on them in professional work.

6. Customer responsibilities (very important)
6.1 You remain responsible for filings and advice
You acknowledge and agree:
- you (and/or your professional staff) remain responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and compliance of any tax return or submission;
- the Services do not provide tax or legal advice; and
- you must use professional judgment and appropriate review processes before filing.

6.2 Rights, permissions, and lawful basis
You must ensure you have all necessary rights, permissions, and lawful bases to:
- provide Customer Data to the Services; and
- connect any Connected Services (including client data sources) to the Services.

Where you act as agent/adviser for end clients, you must obtain any required client authorisations and maintain evidence of those authorisations if required by law, regulator, or professional body rules.

6.3 Data quality
You are responsible for the quality of Customer Data you provide or connect. The Services may produce incomplete or misleading outputs if Customer Data is missing, inconsistent, or out of date.

6.4 Security and account controls
You must:
- ensure Authorised Users keep login credentials secure and do not share accounts;
- promptly notify us of suspected unauthorised access; and
- implement reasonable internal security measures, including offboarding users who no longer require access.

7. Accounts, Authorised Users, and admin controls
7.1 Account creation
You must provide accurate, current account information and keep it updated.

7.2 Authorised Users
You may provision Authorised Users up to the limits of your plan/Order Form. You are responsible for Authorised Users' acts and omissions.

7.3 Admin roles
We may provide admin controls (e.g., role-based access) to allow you to manage Authorised Users and permissions. You are responsible for configuring permissions appropriately.

8. Connected Services (third-party integrations)
8.1 You choose what to connect
The Platform may support integrations with third-party services (e.g., ledgers, Open Banking providers, receipt capture tools, and HMRC APIs where authorised). You decide which Connected Services to connect.

8.2 Third-party terms
Your use of Connected Services is governed by your agreements with those third parties. Taxat is not responsible for third-party services, including their availability, security, accuracy, or any outages.

8.3 Data import and refresh
Connected Services may have limitations (rate limits, refresh cadence, permissions, scopes). We do not guarantee real-time or complete data retrieval from any Connected Service.

9. Acceptable Use
You must comply with the Acceptable Use Policy in Schedule 1.
We may suspend or terminate access for breaches, or to protect the Services, our systems, other customers, or third parties.

Fees (if any) are set out in the Order Form or pricing page at the time you purchase.

10.3 Billing and payment
If fees apply:
- you must pay invoices in accordance with the payment terms in the Order Form (or, if none, within 14 days of invoice date);
- you are responsible for all applicable taxes, including VAT (unless stated otherwise).

10.4 Price changes
We may change pricing for renewals by giving you at least [30] days' notice (or as stated in your Order Form). Price changes do not apply during a prepaid committed term unless the Order Form allows.

11. Changes to the Services
We may update or change the Services to:
- improve performance, security, or functionality;
- comply with law/regulatory requirements; or
- reflect changes to third-party integrations.

We will use reasonable efforts to avoid materially adverse changes during a paid committed term, but you acknowledge that the Services may evolve over time.

12. Intellectual property
12.1 Our IP
We own (or license) all intellectual property rights in the Services, including software, algorithms, UI, documentation, and outputs templates.

A party may disclose Confidential Information if required by law, provided it gives notice (where legally permitted) and discloses only what is required.
